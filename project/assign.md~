Subject
==================

You may either enter a shared Kaggle competition or choose a project of your own.

If you choose to work on a project of your own choosing, it must:
* Have readily available data
* Be of general interest (there should be published guidelines for what constitutes "standard" performance) and should be a problem worth tackling
* Be of specific interest to machine learning: there should be clear and obvious application of the techniques we have used in the course
* Have a baseline that you can implement (or run yourself) easily within a week

If you choose to work on a project of your own choosing, you will be held to a higher standard.  You must clearly document baselines and show improvement over those baselines.  

Proposal
==================

The project proposal is due 2. April.  This one page PDF document
should describe:

* What project you're working on.  If you're not doing the shared competition, you must describe the task, data, and baselines clearly.

* Who is on your team

* What techniques you will explore 

* Your timeline for completing the project (be realistic; you should
  have your first Kaggle submission by 9. November)

Designate **one person** from your group to submit the proposal on
Moodle.  Late days cannot be used on this assignment.
